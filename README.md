### 1) Room8- Find Potential users for the app from Social media

1) Used Data Scraping to mine users from twitter, facebook and craigs list based on hashtag search. (#roomwanted #roommate etc.,)
2) Users were then clustered using K means clustering
3) Calculated similarity indexes, Use CVxpy solver (Gurobi works too), matched the users among each other with the least distance using Linear optimisation 

### 2) Kaggle - Airline Customer Classification

1) Performed classification on a Kaggle dataset using R.
2) with the results and with some more correlation analysis, suggested marketing strategies for customer retention
