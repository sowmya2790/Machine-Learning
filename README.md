Please click "view on github" to access the code files for the following listed projects

### 1) [Room8- Find Potential users for the app from Social media](https://github.com/sowmya2790/Machine-Learning/tree/main/RoomMate%20Matching)

1) Used Data Scraping to mine users from twitter, facebook and craigs list based on hashtag search. (#roomwanted #roommate etc.,)
2) Users were then clustered using K means clustering
3) Calculated similarity indexes, Use CVxpy solver (Gurobi works too), matched the users among each other with the least distance using Linear optimisation 
4) Output and Analysis : [Presentation Link](https://github.com/sowmya2790/Machine-Learning/blob/1b5ce695286c2e7fb5c89efa13bdda7c3b2d79ca/Output%20files/Room8_Presentation.pdf)

### 2) [Kaggle - Airline Customer Classification](https://github.com/sowmya2790/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Kaggle_AirlineData_Classification)

1) Performed classification on a Kaggle dataset using R.
2) with the results and with some more correlation analysis, suggested marketing strategies for customer retention
3) [Output and Analysis Presentation](https://github.com/sowmya2790/Machine-Learning/blob/eaf667263058c539e9df7ef11e62045a40fb6f37/Output%20files/Invistico%20Airlines.pdf)
